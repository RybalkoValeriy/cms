FCms is a smart content management system. When we need to show different data 
on the page based on the different parameters we can implement the logic in the 
views. This approach works fine but requires some coding. 

I believe it is much better to let the CMS do the work for us. With FCMS it is 
much easier to create personalized content that meet your needs.
